**tumult** is a collection of helper scripts for macOS.

## Contribution Guidelines

- **To add a helper script:** Submit a pull request. Please use `#!/usr/bin/env interpreter` instead of a direct path to the interpreter, this makes it easier for people to use more recent versions since the ones packaged macOS are usually  stale.
- **To remove a script:** All of the scripts here were either written by me, copied from blog posts or had an Open Source license. That said, if you wrote something included here and want it removed, either open an issue to discuss the removal or submit a pull request.

Please include an entry in the **Included Scripts** section of `README.md` for any scripts in your PRs so authors get their work credited correctly. Add a link to the source in the comments at the beginning of your script so people can find their other work, and please keep the script descriptions in alphabetical order by script name.

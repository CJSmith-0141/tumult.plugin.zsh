# tumult.plugin.zsh

Tumult is an oh-my-zsh compatible plugin that adds a lot of OS X-specific functions and scripts to your ZSH environment. It is meant to replace the oh-my-zsh osx plugin.

Tumult will check to see if you're running on OS X and not load itself if you aren't. This allows you to use the same plugin list in all your environments without polluting your ZSH with incompatible functions and scripts on non Mac machines.

Tumult uses the Apache 2.0 license.
